# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
forEach is not a high order function that it cannot return the print out. forEach is a method that you can loop through a function. 


To fix this, you should pass the printDouble function itself as the callback to forEach, without invoking it:


```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble);
```
