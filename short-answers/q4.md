# Question
What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer

An inline function is a special type of anonymous function that is assigned to a variable, or in other words, an anonymous function with a name.

```js
// Inline function in JavaScript
let sum = function (x, y) {
    console.log(x + y);
}
// An annonymous function
let product = (x, y) => { console.log(x * y) }
 
// Normal function
 
function maxElement(x, y) {
    if (x > y) console.log(`${x} ix the bigger`);
    else console.log(`${y} is the bigger`);
}
```

An inline function is one that is defined, but not initialized or declared, directly in the code where it is needed or within the context of where it is used. It is also called an anonymous function because it is not given a name when defined.

We use them often for callback functions or when we want to immediately execute something. An example would be using an inline function within a method and logging it to the console:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num)); //1, 2, 3
```
